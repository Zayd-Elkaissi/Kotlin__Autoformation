=> The difference between explicit intents and implicit intents.<br>
explicit intents are used to start a specific component within an app,
while implicit intents are used to request an action from another app component without knowing its exact name.


=> The difference between activities and fragments.<br>
activities and fragments work together to create the user interface of an Android app.
Activities represent individual screens, while fragments are modular components that can be combined with other fragments to create more complex and flexible UIs.
